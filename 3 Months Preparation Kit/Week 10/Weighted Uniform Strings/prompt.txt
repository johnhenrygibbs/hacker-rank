A weighted string is a string of lowercase English letters where each letter has a weight. Character weights are 1 to 26 from a to z.

The weight of a string is the sum of the weights of its characters.

A uniform string consists of a single character repeated zero or more times. For example, "ccc" and "a" are uniform strings, but "bcb" and "cd" are not.

Given a string, s, let U be the set of weights for all possible uniform contiguous substrings of string s. There will be n queries to answer where each query consists of a single integer. Create a return array where for each query, the value is Yes if query[i] âˆˆ U. Otherwise, append No.
