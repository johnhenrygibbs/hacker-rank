This question is designed to help you get a better understanding of basic heap operations.

There are 3 types of query:

1 v - Add an element v to the heap.
2 v - Delete the element v from the heap.
3 - Print the minimum of all the elements in the heap.

NOTE: It is guaranteed that the element to be deleted will be there in the heap. Also, at any instant, only distinct elements will be in the heap.
