A numeric string, s, is beautiful if it can be split into a sequence of two or more positive integers, a[1],a[2],...,a[n] satisfying the following conditions:

1. a[i] - a[i - 1] = 1 for any 1 < i ≤ n (i.e., each element in the sequence is  more than the previous element).

2. No a[i] contains a leading zero. For example, we can split s = 10203 into the sequence {1, 02, 03}, but it is not beautiful because 02 and 03 have leading zeroes.

3. The contents of the sequence cannot be rearranged. For example, we can split s = 312 into the sequence {3, 1, 2}, but it is not beautiful because it breaks our first constraint (i.e., 1 - 3 ≠ 1).
