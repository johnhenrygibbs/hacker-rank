Quicksort usually has a running time of n x log(n), but is there an algorithm that can sort even faster?

In general, this is not possible.

Most sorting algorithms are comparison sorts, i.e. they sort a list just by comparing the elements to one another.

A comparison sort algorithm cannot beat n x log(n) (worst-case) running time, since n x log(n) represents the minimum number of comparisons needed to know where to place each element.
