Implement a simple text editor. The editor initially contains an empty string, S. Perform Q operations of the following 4 types:

append (W) - Append string W to the end of S.
delete (k) - Delete the last k characters of S.
print (k) - Print the k character of S.
undo() - Undo the last (not previously undone) operation of type 1 or 2, reverting S to the state it was in prior to that operation.
