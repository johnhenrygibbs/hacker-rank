Declare a 2-dimensional array, arr, of n empty arrays. All arrays are zero indexed.

Declare an integer, lastAnswer, and initialize it to 0.

There are 2 types of queries, given as an array of strings for you to parse:

Query: 1 x y

1. Let index = ((x ^ lastAnswer) % n)
2. Append the integer y to arr[index]

Query: 2 x y

1. Let index = ((x ^ lastAnswer) % n)
2. Assign the value arr[index][y % size(arr[index])] to lastAnswer
3. Store the new value of lastAnswer to an answers array
4. Finally, size(arr[index]) is the number of elements in arr[index]
